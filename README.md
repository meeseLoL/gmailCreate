# gmailCreate
Attempts to create gmail accounts with randomized first/last name

This does not necessarily work as intended right now, still working out some bugs.

The intention behind this program is to randomly generate first/last birthday/gender gmail accounts and record the information.

The purpose being to sign up for accounts on various websites with intent to resell.
